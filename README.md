OWL Simulator
=============

Simulator for the [OWL](http://hoxtonowl.com/), a programmable audio effects pedal.
All code and documentation published under the Gnu GPL unless otherwise stated: 
http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.txt


1. Compilation and SDKs
=======================
You need to compile the source code to use the OwlSim.
for MAC OSX users: XCode project in /Builds/MacOSX
for Windows users: Visual Studio solutions(2008, 2010 or 2012) available in /Builds
for Linux users: Makefile in /Builds/Linux

To build VSTs, you need the VST SDK 2.4, available here :
https://code.google.com/p/juced/source/browse/trunk/vst/?r=8
Take time to sign the license agreement on www.steinberg.net/en/company/developer.html‎ if 
you haven’t done it already.

(Mac only) The project can build in the AU format as well. You can enable it by setting the 
variable JucePlugin_Build_AU to 0 in /JuceLibraryCode/AppConfig.h.
(Mac only) If you encounter problems of Rez errors due to AUresources.r, Please 
follow the Readme.rtf file located in the /CoreAudioUtilityClasses folder.


2. Write your patch
===================
To write your patch, please use the template TemplatePatch.hpp (in Source/Patches). You 
can write your code directly into it, or create a new file. 

If you create a new file (say, “MyPatch.hpp”) you will need to register it in 
the PatchRegistry.cpp:
- adding the relevant include: 
	#include "Patches/MyPatch.hpp"

- add the following line in Patchregistry::PatchRegistry()
	REGISTER_PATCH(MyPatch, "MyPatch");

In the patch, to get a value (float between 0 and 1) from the knobs, do as follow:
	float valueA = getParameterValue(PARAMETER_A);
	float valueB = getParameterValue(PARAMETER_B);
	float valueC = getParameterValue(PARAMETER_C);
	float valueD = getParameterValue(PARAMETER_D);

The Switch button is acting as a standard Bypass button.


3. Test
=======
The OwlSim will run as a mono plugin. For the moment it is limited to one instance 
at a time (so don’t try to put the OwlSim into more than 1 track at a time :) 
We will change that later of course!
