# OWL Simulator #

Simulator for the [OWL](http://hoxtonowl.com/), a programmable audio effects
pedal. All code and documentation published under the Gnu GPL unless otherwise
stated: http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.txt


1. Compilation and SDKs
-----------------------

### 1.1. VST SDK (All platforms)
To build the OwlSim as a VST, you need the VST SDK 2.4, available on [Steinberg website](http://www.steinberg.net/en/company/developer.html).
Please check in your project settings that the Path to the VST SDK is correct.

### 1.2. Windows 
For Windows users, Visual Studio solutions(2008, 2010 or 2012) are available in /Builds 

### 1.3. Linux
For Linux users, a Makefile is available in /Builds/Linux

### 1.4. Mac OS X
There is an Xcode project in /Builds/MacOSX.
If you are using Xcode version 4.3 or later, you will need to follow the readme.rtf located in /CoreAudioUtilityClasses.
You may also need to set a Rez Search Path in XCode - click on the project title, select the Build Settings tab and set a Rez Search Path to point at the directory you have created and make it recursive (e.g. /Library/Developer/CoreAudio/**)

The project can build in the AU format as well. You can enable it by setting the variable `JucePlugin_Build_AU` to 1 in /JuceLibraryCode/AppConfig.h.
You will find addtional support on the [Juce Forum](http://rawmaterialsoftware.com/juce.php)


2. Write your patch
-------------------

To write your patch, please use the template TemplatePatch.hpp (in Source/Patches).
You can write your code directly into it, or create a new file.

If you create a new file (say, “MyPatch.hpp”) you will need to register it in
the PatchRegistry.cpp: 
- adding the relevant include: 
`  #include "Patches/MyPatch.hpp"  `
- add the following line in Patchregistry::PatchRegistry()
`  REGISTER_PATCH(MyPatch, "MyPatch");  `

In the patch, to get a value (float between 0 and 1) from the knobs, do as
follow: 
`  float valueA = getParameterValue(PARAMETER_A);  `
` float valueB =getParameterValue(PARAMETER_B);  `
` float valueC = getParameterValue(PARAMETER_C);  `
` float valueD = getParameterValue(PARAMETER_D);  `

The Switch button is acting as a standard Bypass button.


3. Test 
-------

The OwlSim will run as a mono plugin. For the moment it is limited to one instance at a time (so don’t try to put the OwlSim into more than 1 track at a time :)
We will change that later of course!
